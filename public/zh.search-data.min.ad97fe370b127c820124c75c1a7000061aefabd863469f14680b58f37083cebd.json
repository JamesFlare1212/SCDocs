Critics, however, claim that many university courses are worthless and young people would be better off gaining skills in the workplace. In this essay, I will examine both sides of this argument and try to reach a conclusion.There are several reasons why young people today believe they have the right to a university education. First, growing prosperity in many parts of the world has increased the number of families with money to invest in their children’s future. At the same time, falling birthrates mean that one- or two-child families have become common, increasing the level of investment in each child. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that young people are willing to let their families support them until the age of 21 or 22. Furthermore, millions of new jobs have been created in knowledge industries, and these jobs are typically open only to university graduates.However, it often appears that graduates end up in occupations unrelated to their university studies. It is not uncommon for an English literature major to end up working in sales, or an engineering graduate to retrain as a teacher, for example. Some critics have suggested that young people are just delaying their entry into the workplace, rather than developing professional skills.\n请依次给到我以下内容：具体分数及其评分依据、文章修改意见、满分范文。\n写小说 # 写一本拥有出人意料结局的推理小说。\n写一个让读者参与其中的交互小说。\n为孩子们写一本激励他们勇敢面对挑战的小说。\n编写一个有关科技创新的未来世界的小说。\n创造一个让读者感到沉浸其中的幻想故事。\n充当 Linux 终端 #
